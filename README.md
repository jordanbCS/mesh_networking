# Mesh networking in 2021  

Best option for now is probably a kind of "line of site repeater". 

## Devices  

Probably need a device like #1 to get things going asap, but #2 should be explored in parallel.  

### 1. "The EZ-Bridge-Lite EZBR-0214+ High Power Outdoor Wireless Point to Point System"  

CA: $377.95 https://www.amazon.ca/EZ-Bridge-Lite-EZBR-0214-Outdoor-Wireless-System/dp/B002K683V0  
US: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002K683V0  

### 2. "librerouter"  

Open source community oriented project that has some good long-term reasons to pursue it.

 - In order to order a LibreRouter you need to send an email to librerouter@altermundi.net

### Apps  

Not sure to what extent these apps will extend range by daisy-chaining along a route but no harm trying.

   - "firechat" looks like an archived project. Which is too bad as it looks to have had a decent track record, and claims to be secure for person to person communication with end to end encryption.

   - the "Signal Offline Messenger" looks like it would be very convenient but the reviews are so bad...

   - "bridgefy" is, according to Ars Technica 08/2020, not secure.

   - I was unable to dowload "Serval mesh" for Android and the website looks last updated in 2018.

   - "Briar" looks like it could be something. Reviews are sparse but nothing obviously damning. Apparently end to end encrypted etc...
